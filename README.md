## SWAPibox

SWAPI-BOX was our first project of Module 3 that required us to use asynchronous fetch calls to a Star Wars API. Character, planet, vehicle, film, species, and starshp data is then organized into a fun UI with reusable React components. Users can browse these various categories and favorite their favorite Star Wars cards. 

## Project Goals:

* Asynchronously call and fetch data when the user requests it.
* Implement SRP (single responsbility principle) in application logic.
* Create modular, reusable React components.
* Create a well constructed UI.
* Use propTypes to manipulate props passed to each component.
* Write meaningful, comprehensive unit and integration tests.
